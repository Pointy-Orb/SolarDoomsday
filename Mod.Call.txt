Mod.Call can be used with this mod to mark your specific modded tiles and walls as flammable or as fire-safe.

You should do this in PostSetupContent, otherwise your call will just be ignored.

The first argument corresponds to where you would like to mark the ID:
"MakeTileFlammable" - Marks the tile as a tile that can burn
"MakeTileMeltable" - Marks the tile as a tile that can melt*
"MakeTileMeltImmune" - Marks the tile as a tile that cannot melt. Intended to undo the Stone melting clause

"MakeWallFireSafe" - Marks the wall as a wall that grants immunity to Solar Flame and Heat Stroke when standing behind it.

*Tiles in the "Stone" tileset have this set to true automatically, so if your tile is in that tileset you don't need to do this.


The second argument should then be the ID of the tile or wall that you wish to mark. 
This can be done with either TileID for vanilla or ModContent.TileType<>() for modded tiles, or whatever method you prefer for getting your tile types.
